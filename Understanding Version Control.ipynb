    "(1) As soon as you have a local repository, you can start working on your files: modify, delete, add, copy, rename, or move files in whatever application (your favorite editor, a file browser, ...) you prefer. In this step, you don't have to watch out for anything. Just make any changes necessary to move your project forward.\n",

    "(2) It's only when you feel you've reached a noteworthy state that you have to consider version control again. Then it's time to wrap up your changes in a commit. \n",
    "\n",
    "(3) However, before you commit, you'll want to get an overview of what you've changed so far. In Git, you'll use the \"status\" command to get a list of all the changes you performed since the last commit: which files did you change? Did you create any new ones or deleted some old ones?\n",
    "\n",
    "(4) Next, you tell Git which of your local changes you want to wrap up in the next commit. Only because a file was changed doesn't mean it will be part of the next commit! Instead, you have to explicitly decide which changes you want to include. To do this, you add them to the so-called \"Staging Area\".\n",
    "\n",
    "(5) Now, having added some changes to the Staging Area, it's time to actually commit these changes. You'll have to add a short and meaningful message that describes what you actually did. The commit will then be recorded in your local Git repository, marking a new version of your project.\n",
    "\n",
    "(6) From time to time, you'll want to have a look at what happened in the project - especially if you're working together with other people. The \"log\" command lists all the commits that were saved in chronological order. This allows you to see which changes were made in detail and helps you comprehend how the project evolved.\n",
    "\n",
    "(7) Also when collaborating with others, you'll both want to share (some of) your changes with them and receive the changes they made. A remote repository on a server is used to make this exchange possible."
